# Arop채: Peer Review made Easy

Arop채 is a web-based system which supports peer review activities.
In a peer-review activity, an instructor sets students an
assignment. After students have submitted their assignment, they
comment on the submissions from other students. Once the review
process is complete, students read the comments their peers have made
on their own submission.

Arop채 is used extensively at the University of Auckland and
Glasgow University.  It is also used world-wide, with regular use at
the following institutions:

* Franklin University
* Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences
* Sheffield University
* Curtin University
* Robert Gordon University
* Glasgow Caledonian University
* Washington & Lee University
* Virginia Tech

In the 2014/5 academic year, just over 5% of the entire student body
of the University of Glasgow used the system to review their peers'
work.

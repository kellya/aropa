# Aropä: Peer Review made Easy - Information for students

Taking part in a peer review activity on Aropä involves these steps:

* Submit the essay (or report, or computer program, etc.) you wrote
  for the coursework assignment

* Read a selection of essays (or reports, etc.) written by other
  students. These are (usually) allocated randomly by the system, so
  you probably won't know (and should't care!) who the other student
  is.  They won't know who you are, either.

* Fill in a review form with your comments and (possibly) some marks
  for each essay (or report, etc.) that you read.

* Once the reviewing deadline has passed, have a look at the comments
  other students have written about your own work. You will also be
  able to read reviews written by other students on the same essays
  (or reports, etc.)  you reviewed.

## How do I write a review?

You may never have written a review of a fellow student's work
before - don't worry: your instructor will have prepared a review form
for you to fill in when you write your reviews. A link to this will
appear after you download the allocated essay (or report, etc.). The
form will tell you which specific or general areas to comment on, and
may also include some radio buttons you can click on.

## Why do I need to do this?

Peer review is good for you in several ways. First, you get to read a
selection of material written by other students studying in the same
class. There will usually be some who are better and some who are
worse than you. Reading their work will tell give you an idea about
how you compare, and whether you need to put more work into the
course.

While reviewing, you'll come across a range of approaches to the
assignment. Some better, some worse, and some just different. You may
learn new ways of approaching the topic, and notice problems and
misunderstandings to avoid!

Going through the process of marking helps you to understand better
what your lecturer expects of you in the assignment. You will start to
earn better marks as you get a better idea of what is wanted in the
assessment.

Peer reviewing trains you to make judgements on someone else's
work. Is it good, or bad? Are there mistakes? How could it be
improved? With practice, you will soon start to think about mistakes
you make with your own work, and how to recognise and correct
them. This is a key skill, one that will stay with you throughout your
life.

# Aropä: Peer Review made Easy - Information for instructors

An Aropä peer-review assignment has the following steps:

* The instructor specifies the requirements for submission (for
  example, a pdf file, a PowerPoint file etc.), the closing date for
  submissions, and the closing date for reviews.

* The instructor defines a rubric to guide students in their
  reviewing, and indicates how many assignments each student should
  review.

* Students upload their assignment submissions.

* After the submission deadline, students review other students'
  submissions online using the specified rubric.

* After the review deadline, students can see other students' reviews
  of their own work, as well as all reviews of the submissions that
  they themselves have reviewed.

* If the rubric has included quantitative judgements (e.g. allocation
  of marks, or Likert scales), the instructor can download marks for
  each submission.

The [Aropä User Guide](AropaGuide5.pdf) describes the whole process of
getting started, setting up a course and an assignment, creating a
rubric, and monitoring and accessing the student activity. It also
describes the range of different features and options. Because it is a
good idea to plan the whole peer-review activity from start-to-finish,
this guide is intended to be read from beginning to end before
starting (you will find the system much easier to understand if you do
this!)

The [Aropä FAQ document](AropaFAQ1.pdf) provides answers to frequent queries we get from instructors and students.

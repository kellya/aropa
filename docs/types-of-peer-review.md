# Aropä: Peer Review made Easy - Types of peer review

This note clarifies some of the terminology used in the Aropä
documentation.

## Activity types

A _peer review activity_ is a structured sequence of writing and
reviewing tasks. The simplest activity is to have students review one
or more texts selected by the instructor. Such _review practice tasks_
are useful for familiarising students with the reviewing process and
for developing reviewing skills.

The most common form of peer review is a _two-step_ activity in which
students write an assignment and then review one or (usually) more
submissions written by other students.

A two-step activity can be extended into a _three-step_ activity by
having students write a draft, perform a peer review on each other’s
drafts, and then incorporate the feedback they receive into a final
version. If more than one round of peer review is included, this
becomes an _N-step_ activity.

## Variations

Three- and N-step activities can include a _review marking_ task. This
is where the reviews written in a previous step are themselves
reviewed.

The reviewing step can include tutors as well as peers, in a _double
review_. The feedback from tutors can be mixed with the feedback
from peers, or returned separately.

Group assignments can be reviewed, and reviewing can be done by
individuals or in groups.

_Tutor-only reviews_ are also possible, although they are not
technically peer reviews. The final phase in a three- or _N_-step peer
review activity is often tutor-only.
